# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- When comparing values and checking if something is true or not
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- Check if 0 is a multple of anything ahead of time and not use curly braces for ruby
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- Just seeing something work as intended, but also finding a flaw that I didn't realize existed. Initialy I feel down but I'm glad I found the issue now instead of later.
